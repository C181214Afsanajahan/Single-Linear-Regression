Single Linear Regression by afsanajahan2342@gmail.com using python.

# Predicting a response using a single feature.

It is a method to predict the dependent variable (Y) based on the values of independent variable (X). It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find out a linear function that predicts the response value (y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature (or independent variable) (x).

In ML Algorithms we have :

1)Supervised Learning
2)Unsupervised Learning
In Supervised Learning we have :

a)Regression

b)Classification

Firstly, we discuss about different types of Regressions.

1)Linear Regression
2)Simple Linear Regression
3)Multi-linear Regression
4)Logistic Regression
5)Lasso Regression
6)Ridge Regression


Here i worked for simple/single linear regression.

*Python Libraries used*

1)Pandas.
2)NumPy.
3)Matplotib.

(Including formula calculation: Y=mx+c).
